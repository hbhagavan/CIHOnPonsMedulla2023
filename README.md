## snRNA-seq of pons-medulla
This page features R code for analyzing single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) datasets of Normoxia and CIH using the Seurat v4.0 package as employed in the manuscript. The analysis covers a series of steps starting with initial quality control (QC) steps, doublet removal, normalization, integration,  UMAP dimensionality reduction and cell annotation proceeds through obtaining the final count that the data was used for differentially expressed genes (DEGs), transcription factors (TF), and CellChat analysis
